# React-Redux-Boilerplate

This is just a boilerplate repository using Redux Toolkit to get you started with the development of your application right away without worrying about the its configurations. The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

    "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
    "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
    "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

It provides you with the following packages out of the box.

- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux.js.org/)
- [ReactStrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

Complete configuration of redux store is also present, you need not to worry for that.
